# Injury Analysis Across Age Groups and Sports

As a part of the analysis, the repository is also going to document the injury statistics across the athletes from the years 2021-2025. This Power BI dashboard visualizes and analyzes injury data across various age groups, genders, sports, and severity categories for athletes. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into athlete health and other metrics.

**Overall Injury Metrics:** Total injuries (15K), average recovery days (48.71 days), and cumulative medical costs (€27.7M) for the selected period.

### Analytical Insights

**Female athletes**, especially those aged 30+ in indoor sports, are most susceptible to injuries.
